## Chef is trying to invent the light bulb that can run at room temperature without electricity. 
## So he has N gases numbered from 0 to Nâˆ’1 that he can use and he doesn't know which one of the N gases will work but we do know it.
## Now Chef has worked on multiple search algorithms to optimize search. For this project, he uses a modulo-based search algorithm that he invented himself. 
## So first he chooses an integer K and selects all indices i in increasing order such that imodK=0 and test the gases on such indices, then all indices i in increasing order such that imodK=1, and test the gases on such indices, and so on.
## Given N, the index of the gas p that will work, and K, find after how much time will he be able to give Chefland a new invention assuming that testing 1 gas takes 1 day.
